About usage:
- Tileset functions on a 3x3/1.5 unit scale.
- Floor tiles can be vertex snapped, walls should be positioned using precise positions.
- Only items not to be positioned on a grid are the doors, these need to be positioned within their frames.
- Edges (Pref_Wall_Edge, Pref_Ceiling_Edge_Wide, Pref_Ceiling_Edge_Narrow) can be used when the edges of ceilings are visible (as in under balconies).
